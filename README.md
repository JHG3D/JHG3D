Hi, I'm Jack Hidde Glavimans.
I am a technical artist that loves proceduralism, VFX, rigging and python.
Due to this I mainly work with Houdini because of the awesome one in all package it is for this.
Besides that I use Unreal Engine to put everything together!
Feel free to email me for questions or requests at JHG-3D@Outlook.com
